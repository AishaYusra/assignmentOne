                Malala Yousafzai, the 26-year old Pakistani female education activist is someone i look up to because
                her
                story is indeed very inspiring, especially to the girl-child. She is the youngest Nobel Prize laureate,
                receiving the award only at the age of 17. She is a human rights advocate for the education of women and
                children in her homelad, Swat, where the Pakistani Taliban had at times banned girls from attending
                school.
                Her advocacy has in fact grown into an international movement. Several personalities including Barack
                Obama
                are her role models, but she was also inspired by her fathers humanitarian work who was also an
                activist. On
                the 9th of October, 2012, while on a bus in Swat District after taking an exam, Malala and two other
                girls
                were shot by a Taliban gunman in an assassination attampt, targeting Malala for her activism. The gunman
                fled the scene and unfortunatly she was struck in the head by a bullet. She was in critical condition at
                the
                Rawalpindi Institute of Crdiology after which she was transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in
                Birmingham, UK. The incident sparked an outpouring of support from all around the world and was even
                tagged
                as <i>the most famous teenager in the world</i>. Weeks after the attempted murder, a group of 50 leading
                Muslim clerics issued a <i>fatwa</i> against those who ried to kill her. The Pakistni Taliban were
                denounced
                by governments, human rights organizations and feminist groups. They, in retaliation also denounced
                Yousafzai, indicating plans to attempt another assassination on her life. After her recovery, Yousafzai
                became a prominent activist for the <i>right to education</i>. Based in Birmingham, she co-founded the
                MALALA FUND, a non-profit organization with Shiza Shahid. In 2013, she co-authored I AM MALALA, an
                international best seller. In 2012, she received Pakistani's first National Youth Peace Prize and the
                2013
                Sakharov Prize. In 2014, she was the co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize at the age of 17. In
                2015,
                she was the subject of the Oscar-shortlisted documentary HE NAMED ME MALALA. The 2013,2014,2015 issues
                of
                TIME Magazine featured her as one of the most influential people gloally. In 2017, she was awarded
                honoay
                Canadian citizenship and became the youngest person to address the House of Commons of Canada. Yousafzai
                completed her secondary school education at Edgbaston High School, Birmingham in England. From there se
                won
                a place at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford and studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics and graduated in
                2020.
                She returned in 2023 to become the youngest ever Hpnorary fellow at Linacre College, Oxford. Yousafzai
                addressed the UN in July 2013, and had an audience with the Queen Elizabeth II in Buckingham Palace. In
                September, she spoke at Harvard University, and in October she met with US President Barack Obama and
                his
                family; during that meeting, she confronted him on his use of drone strikes in Pakistan. In December,
                she
                addressed the Oxford Union. In July 2014, Malala spoke at the Girl Summit in London. In October 2014,
                she
                donated $50,000 to the UNTWA for reconstruction of schools on the Gaza Strip. On 12 July 2015, her 18th
                Birthday, Malala opened a school in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon, near the Syrian border, for Syrian
                refugees.
                These are just a few of the many achievements of Malala Yousafzai. She is currently happily married to
                Asser Malik.
