        <p>
            I have several mentors or role models as some would put it. But one that always stands out for me is the
            first wife of the prophet Muhammad SAW, Nana Khadijah bint Khuwaylid RA. She was born in c.555 or 567 in
            Makkah, Saudi Arabia. She had 6 children with the prophet SAW, 2 boys and 6 girls. In Islam, she is often
            referred to as <i>The Mother of the Believers.</i> She is also one of the four ladies of heaven. Khadijah
            RA, was a successful merchant. It is said that her caravans equaled that of the traders of Quraysh put
            together. She was given many honorifics, including <i>Ameerat-Quraish</i>; Princess of Quraish, The Pious
            One, and <i>Khadijah al-Kubra</i>;Khadijah the Great. She was a very wealthy woman and she used her wealth
            wisely by feeding and clothing the poor, assisting her relatives financially, and providing marriage
            portions for poor relations. In 595, Khadijah needed a co-worker for a transaction in Syria so she hired
            Muhammad SAW, then 25 years old for the trade in Syria sending word that she would pay to double her usual
            commission. Later on, following the Islamic way of marriage in Islam, she got married to the prophet
            Muhammad SAW. At that time he was 25 years old and she was 40 years old.When Muhammad SAW reported his first
            revelation from Angel Jibril, Khadijah RA was the first person to accept The Truth i.e. she accepted Islam.
            After his experience in the cave of Hira and Muhammad returned home i a state of terror, Khadijah comforted
            him with the words of Allah. Khadijah was supportive of Muhammad's prophetic mission, always helping in his
            work, proclaiming his message and belittling any opposition to his prophecies. Her constant encouragement
            helped Muhammad believe in his mission to spread Islam. When the polytheists and aristocrats of the Quraish
            harassed Muslims, she used her money to ransom muslim slaves and feed the muslim community. Khadijah died in
            Ramadan of the year 10 after the Prophethood. She is said to have been around 65 years old at the time of
            her death. She was buried in Janat al-Mu'alla cemetry, in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Khadijah was a fine woman,
            she had several qualities that anyone would admire. She was highly regarded in society and in the eyes of
            Allah. I admire how she was very supportive to her relatives and the entire community at large and it never
            ran her pockets dry. This only proves that giving doesn't lessen your riches rather it enriches you even
            more. She was also a very loving and supportive wife which is a quality of hers that i admire a lot too. She
            was wealthy but she was still modest and humble in everything she approached. <br> She is one of my biggest
            inspirations because she lived a simple, yet fulfilled life. </p>

        <h4>Unfortunately, for obvious reasons, i have no image of her to insert. One thing is for sure though, she was
            a beautiful woman.</h4>
